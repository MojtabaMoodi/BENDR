# Gender Classification Dataset Configuration
# Configuration for Sleep-EDF dataset adapted for binary gender prediction
# This replaces sleep stage labels with gender labels extracted from EDF headers

sleep-edf-gender:
  name: "Sleep EDF Gender Classification"  # Human-readable dataset name
  toplevel: /Volumes/Data/SSC/sleep-cassette/  # Root directory containing EDF files
  tmin: 0  # Start time for epochs (0 = beginning of each 30s chunk)
  tlen: 30  # Length of each epoch in seconds (matches sleep study standard)
  
  # Data normalization bounds (derived from Sleep-EDF dataset statistics)
  data_max: 4460.6  # Maximum expected EEG amplitude (μV)
  data_min: -4465.7  # Minimum expected EEG amplitude (μV)
  
  extensions:
    - .edf  # Process only EDF (European Data Format) files
    
  chunk_duration: 30  # Create 30-second chunks for person-level classification
  
  # File exclusion patterns
  # Only include PSG files (actual EEG data), exclude hypnogram files (annotations)
  exclude_sessions:
    - "*Hypnogram*"  # Exclude all annotation files containing sleep stage labels
    
  # Gender events mapping - binary classification
  # Our custom loader will create events with codes 1 (female) and 2 (male)
  # These are then mapped to class indices for neural network training
  events:
    1: 0  # Map female (code 1) to class 0 for binary classification
    2: 1  # Map male (code 2) to class 1 for binary classification
    
  # Channel name standardization
  # Sleep-EDF uses non-standard channel names that need mapping to 10-20 system
  rename_channels:
    FPZ: 'EEG Fpz-Cz'  # Frontal pole to central reference
    PZ: 'EEG Pz-Oz'    # Parietal to occipital reference  
    HEOGL: "EOG horizontal"  # Horizontal electrooculogram
    
  # Channel selection for EEG analysis
  picks:
    - eeg  # Use only EEG channels (exclude EOG, EMG, other physiological signals)
    
  # Channels to exclude from analysis
  exclude_channels:
    - "Resp oro-nasal"  # Respiratory signal (not relevant for gender prediction)
    - 'EMG submental'   # Chin muscle activity (sleep-related, not gender-specific)
    - 'Temp rectal'     # Body temperature (not relevant for EEG-based gender prediction)
    - 'Event marker'    # Annotation markers (not neural data)
    
  # Training hyperparameters optimized for gender classification
  train_params:
    epochs: 10  # Number of training epochs (increased for gender classification convergence)
    batch_size: 8  # Batch size (increased since gender is person-level, more stable)
    balance_method: undersample  # Handle class imbalance by undersampling majority class
    validation_interval: 1000  # Validate every 1000 training steps
    
  lr: 0.00005  # Learning rate (conservative for fine-tuning pre-trained models)
  folds: 10    # Number of cross-validation folds for robust evaluation
  
  # Number of target classes (binary: female/male)
  targets: 2   # Binary classification: 0 = female, 1 = male
