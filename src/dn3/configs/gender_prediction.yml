# Gender Prediction Experiment Configuration
# This configuration file sets up BENDR for binary gender classification
# instead of the original sleep stage classification task

Configuratron:
  use_only:
    - sleep-edf-gender  # Use only the gender classification variant of Sleep-EDF
  preload: True  # Preload data into memory for faster processing
  sfreq: 256  # Resample all data to 256 Hz for consistency across subjects
  deep1010:
    return_mask: False  # Don't return channel masking information (not needed for classification)

# Pre-trained model weights from the original BENDR sleep stage classification
# These weights provide strong EEG feature representations for transfer learning
encoder_weights: /Volumes/Data/encoder.pt  # Pre-trained convolutional encoder weights
context_weights: /Volumes/Data/contextualizer.pt  # Pre-trained transformer contextualizer weights

# Include dataset-specific configuration for gender classification
datasets: !include configs/gender_datasets.yml
