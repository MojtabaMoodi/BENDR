# Evaluation Metrics Configuration
# List the (additional, Accuracy is always included) metrics used by the downstream datasets and their chance values
# The *first* metric will be used to generate plots.
# Specify the chance level of the metric as associated value, if not specified, assumed to be 0.5

# Motor Movement/Imagery (MMI) Database metrics
mmidb:
  - bac  # Balanced accuracy for multi-class motor imagery

# BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a metrics  
bci_iv_2a:
  - Accuracy: 0.25  # 4-class motor imagery (25% chance level)

# Error-Related Negativity (ERN) dataset metrics
ern:
  - auroc  # Area under ROC curve for error detection

# Event-Related Potential BCI dataset metrics
erpbci:
  - auroc  # Area under ROC curve for P300 detection

# Sleep-EDF dataset metrics (original sleep stage classification)
sleep-edf:
  - bac: 0.2  # Balanced accuracy for 5-class sleep staging (20% chance level)

# Sleep-EDF Gender Classification metrics (NEW)
# Binary gender prediction from EEG signals extracted from sleep data
sleep-edf-gender:
  - bac: 0.5    # Balanced accuracy for binary gender classification (50% chance level)
  - auroc: 0.5  # Area under ROC curve for gender discrimination (50% chance level)
